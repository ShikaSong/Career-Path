Work is exhausting , I completely lost passion for life and unwilling to keep learning. Work is not that hard, but still extract all my energy. I always want to take a good sleep, but hard to realize it. I slept too late, but get up too early. I really want to relax myself, but instead, I push myself even harder in work, I am afraid of losing this job, but still I want to find a more technical fields, rather than be thought as a no-technical guy in development team, and a relative technique guy in Market team. Well, I want to learn more about the world, I don't want to be treated like this, I wish to be respected. I knew though if I want to choose the dream job at least for now that is my ideal job, I need to learn the skills it needs and prepare for it ahead.

Bad day, Just so bad, because I really don't want a 007 job. That is terrible!!!

What do I really WANT?

I want to be a technical guy with rich knowledge in as many as possible fields. So far, I want to become a software engineer who has relatively high salary and also with relatively much better respect from other people.
To Achieve this goal, what should I do in Ten years! When I am already 34 years old.

> In the year of 2034, I actually don't think there will be much coding work for people to do alone. As More we use AI to assist us. So what is the key points for the job of a software engineer.  I still think logical thinking and vast knowledge input matters. It will make you think more wisely. A broaden horizon matters. More over, I should be respected as a elder person with rich knowledge base. Instead the others would be very astonished and say wow! how can you know that !!
