You could learn more about me in this part. How should I live a fullfilled and meaningful life.
My past working experience:Testing and customer aftersale support. I have learned a lot from this company, though I also start thinking about my career path. I could not learn as much as I have expected before. I expect a more challenging career path rather than customer service.
