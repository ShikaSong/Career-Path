##  0705 Update

Work is exhausting , I completely lost passion for life and unwilling to keep learning. Work is not that hard, but still extract all my energy. I always want to take a good sleep, but hard to realize it. I slept too late, but get up too early. I really want to relax myself, but instead, I push myself even harder in work, I am afraid of losing this job, but still I want to find a more technical fields, rather than be thought as a no-technical guy in development team, and a relative technique guy in Market team. Well, I want to learn more about the world, I don't want to be treated like this, I wish to be respected. I knew though if I want to choose the dream job at least for now that is my ideal job, I need to learn the skills it needs and prepare for it ahead.
